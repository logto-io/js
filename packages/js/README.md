## What is this and how does it work?

Logto JavaScript SDK (a.k.a JS core) is the foundation of the entire JavaScript SDK family (Browser, Next.js, React, Vue, etc.). Usually you are not expected to use it directly in your application, as we have released a set of official SDKs to help you integrate Logto with your favorite JavaScript frameworks. [Check this out](https://docs.logto.io/docs/recipes/integrate-logto/) and get started!

If Logto does not support your framework and you want to contribute by building a new SDK from scratch, we recommend checking out our [Browser SDK](https://github.com/logto-io/js/tree/master/packages/browser) and [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/logto-io/js/tree/master/packages/node) and start from there.
